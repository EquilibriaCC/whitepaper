Hello Equinauts,
As you probably know, the hardfork v18 passed successfully, which we are very satisfied with.
However, we want to inform you about something very important. 
On the blocks immediately after the fork, additional coins were generated that do not count to the total emission.
The purpose of this operation is to ensure the financial liquidity of the network and the project. 
The XEQs issued will be presented on the days in the document for which they will be intended and the main one is to secure liquidity on crosschain for wXEQ.
Confirmation of this will also be mapped in the Explorer we are working on.
There is about 380 accounts on wXEQ with amount greater than 1 and more than 23 mln tokens.
We will allow to change that wXEQ -> XEQ also we will safe liquidity for wXEQ V3 token that should run on few crosschains.
For the minted XEQ will be divided :

- for old wXEQ swap made by previous owner
- for each crosschain for wXEQ V3 
- the rest amount for liquidity and listing on exchanges
- main XEQ code developers, people who develop other services, servers maintenance, services and all the rest

We do belive that this reserve will allow the Oracle to be finalized.
The project is still being developed and, as you can see, we are doing everything to ensure its correct direction and transparency.
